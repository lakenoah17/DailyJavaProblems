    //This problem was asked by Facebook.
    //
    //Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26,
    // and an encoded message, count the number of
    // ways it can be decoded.
    //
    //For example, the message '111' would give 3,
    // since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka',
    // and 'ak'.
    //
    //You can assume that the messages are decodable.
    // For example, '001' is not allowed.
